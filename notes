* Both crates and modules act as namespaces within a project
* Modules can contain other modules (e.g. module1::module2::...)
* Crates are the top-level in the crate-module hierarchy (e.g. crate1::crate1_module1::crate1_module1_module_2...)
* The namespace of the current crate can beaccessed via 'crate'(e.g. crate::module1::...)
* Everything in a module is private to that module by default. 
  Use the `pub` keyword to make it accessible from outside of the module.

* Module scope is organized within a tree structure. You can access other parts of the tree with:
    super:: - this gives you the module immediately above your current module in the module scope tree
    crate:: - this accesses the root of the tree (main.rs)
